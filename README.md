# wisefrog

wisefrog is a Deep Learning based model that classifies LBS according to the physical and chemical properties of atoms. Moreover, our model characterizes atoms by its environment (geometrically, the atoms that surround it), which gives a precise and specific perspective of how LBS are composed and classifies whether an atom or residue belongs to a LBS or not. 
We decided on the “wisefrog” name for many reasons. The term “Wise” conveys the idea of intelligence, sagacity, and deep understanding. Meanwhile, "Frog" symbolizes adaptability, agility, and precision, akin to the predictor's ability to navigate diverse environments and accurately identify LBS. All in all, just as a frog captures its prey with precision and efficiency, "WiseFrog" encapsulates the intelligence, adaptability, and precision essential for a successful ligand binding site predictor.
